Time Conflict Finder -- Ian Price

This program will allow the user to insert several timeframes, then find and clearly display conflicts
within a schedule. I am designing this program because I believe it would be very useful for designing
schedules and making plans.

I expect that this project will not be very mechanically complex, but will likely require a higher than
average amount of effort dedicated to visual design.
