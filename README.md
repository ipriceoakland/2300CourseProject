# 2300CourseProject - Schedule Planner
This program allows users to add events with a name, description, and start and end time to a schedule, and will automatically find conflicts between them.

# How to Use:
Upon opening the program, timelines for each day of the week, an "Add Schedule Event" button, and a "Remove Schedule Event" button will be visible.

## To Add an Event:
- Click the "Add Schedule Event" button. The button will change to a yellow-colored "Cancel" button, which can be clicked to cancel this process.
- Click on two points on a timeline. The location you click on the timeline will determine the start and end times of the event.
- A new window will appear with text inputs for name and description, and an "Add Event" button.
- Type a name and description for the event into the appropriate inputs, then click the "Add Event" button.
- The new window will close, and a rectangle representing the newly created event will appear on the timeline.

## To Remove an Event:
- Click the "Remove Schedule Event" button. The button will change to a "Cancel" button, similar to how the "Add Schedule Event" button works.
- Click on the event you wish to remove. This will remove the event from the timeline along with any conflicts it causes.

## To View an Event:
- If either the "Add Schedule Event" or "Remove Schedule Event" buttons have been pressed, click the "Cancel" button.
- While neither adding nor removing an event, click on the event or conflict that you wish to see information about.
- A new window will open which will show all available information on the chosen event or conflict.
